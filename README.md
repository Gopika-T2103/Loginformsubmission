# Loginformsubmission
This project is a simple Login/Register Form Submission system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with Node.js and Express.js handling the backend.
MongoDB is used as the database to store user details securely.When a new user accesses the form, they are prompted to register, after which they are redirected to the home page. 
Existing users can log in directly using their username and password.
For enhanced security, user passwords are hashed before being stored in the database. 
 This project demonstrates basic user authentication and secure data handling in a full-stack web application.
